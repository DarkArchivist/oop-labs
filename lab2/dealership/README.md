# OOP Lab6

This lab is based on the Generator, Constants and Config classes which all come from the util package.
Generator is used for generating data that has a possible dataset predefined in the constants class.
Config is used for running the program.


General flow: Customer is generated, takes a random car for a drive, bonus satisfactory factor is collected throughout the cycle and soome events are defined in between, such as car brokes down during test drive, review for the seller and the buyout of the car.
